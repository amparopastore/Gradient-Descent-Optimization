# Gradient-Descent-Optimization

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook that demonstrates the implementation of gradient descent for function minimization.

## Overview

Gradient descent is an optimization algorithm used to minimize functions by iteratively moving towards the minimum value of the function. This notebook illustrates the concept using a simple function and provides a step-by-step explanation of the process.
